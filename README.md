I thought it would be fun to be able to "talk to" your Anki flashcard deck. I implemented a very naive Anki/Supermemo-esque spaced repetition algorithm, an ingester for Anki SQLite databases, and wired it up to GPT3. I really liked it actually, 75% of the time, but I could never get the prompt working great. Perhaps it would work well with a more sophisticated LLM or better wiring.

(What the UI looks like, with the AI summarization dialed down a lot for testing:)
